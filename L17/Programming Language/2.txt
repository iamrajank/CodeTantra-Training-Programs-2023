Understanding exactly the inputs the algorithm needs is the fundamental to understanding the problem.


Algorithmic design techniques are the cornerstone for designing algorithms for problems.


Pseudocode, Flowcharts are methods of expressing an algorithm.


An Algorithm should be both time and space efficient besides being simple.
